// StableTypeId is not stable across binaries so dynamic loading will not work. For example this will cause python bindings of one create to not be able to communicate properly with python bindings of another crate. The two libraries are dynamically linked when imporing in python but the component that are added by one binding do not have the same type as the oen from the other crate, even if it's exactly the same rust type that was imported using use::other_crate::component.
// for this we neeed a stable id
// more info: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/32
// https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1444
// inspired by the original implementation of TypeId in rust
